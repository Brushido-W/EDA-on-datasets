This README file contains a detailed discription for the last 2 Capstone projects.

Capstone Project II (Automobile)

The purpose of the project is to perform a EDA to have a better understanding of the automobile dataset, 
not only that but to also identify obvious errors, as well as understand patterns within the data, detect 
outliers or anomalous events and find interesting relations among the variables.

In the Automobile datsset all the data is being analyzed. It is done by reading the text file and structuring
the data in a table to be easier to read. From there the data is mainly analyzed by craeting visualizations. 
The visualizations were created to shows us the different trends and relationships within the dataset and help 
us understand the dataset.

After performing a successful EDA our top 10 main findings of the dataset is that:

1. Toyota, Nissan and Mazda are 3 most common cars and Mercury, Renault and Chervrolet are the 3 least most common cars.
2. Only a small amount of people own convertible and hardtop cars. The sedan body-style and hatchback are the most desireble car body styles.
3. The average price for cars is just above 10 000.
4. The average cars horsepower is just under 100.
5. The higher the price the higher the horsepower.
6. The higher the engine size the higher the horsepower.
7. A very strong direct relationship between Highway-mpg and City-mpg.
8. Almost all cars have their engines in the front.
9. The compression ratio with 9.0 it is by far the most common.
10. The average peak-rpm is about 52 000.


Capstone Project III (Medicine)

The purpose of the project is to also perform a EDA to have a better understanding of the dataset, check for 
missing data and other mistakes, gain maximum insight into the data set and its underlying structure. 

In the Medicine dataset not all the data was analyzed. This is because the dataset contained multiple null values.
I then had to drop all rows with any null values and only then started analyzing the dataset. I did this by also 
creating multiple visualizations and this was so we v=can check for any relationshps, trends and develop an 
understanding of the medicine dataset.

After performing a successful EDA our top 10 main findings of the dataset is that:

1. The Nappi code, SEP and Manufacturer price have the highest values in the dataset.
2. The most common company is Adclock Ingram Care which has more than 170 applications.
3. The average Manufacturer price is about 120.
4. The average the unit price is very checp and below 30.
5. The higher the Unit Price the higher the Manufacturer Price.
6. The higher the Unit Price the higher the VAT Price.
7. The average SEP for the dataset rangest from 100 to about 300.
8. The two types of medication have a similar count with the originator having a slightly higher value than the generic mediation.
9. The Calcium Chloride is the most common ingredient and is found in more than 25 medicatons.
10. The 4 most common medications are Hytrim, Sabax Dianeal 2.5, Sabax Dianeal LS 4.25 and Sabax Dianeal Normal Calcium with 1.5%.
